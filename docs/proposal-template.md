# Introduction

This project is intended to help me learn a new skill set that will be particularly beneficial in my professional career: the Microsoft Power Platform. More specifically, the project will focus on building a Power Application for project time-management. 

The application will enable more accurate and efficient recording and analysis of time spent on project tasks with an easy-to-utilize time-tracking interface that allows project resources to allocate time to specific tasks and assignments. In addition, it will allow a Project Manager to create tasks, assign project resources, and monitor actual time versus expected or projected time as well as the status of those tasks. In this way, the application will enhance the work experience of both the project manager and project resources by reducing the amount of effort required to manually track hours and will provide early identification of and response to potential project issues by comparing the quoted, estimated hours to actual time spent and status. 

# Anticipated Technologies

This project will require Microsoft Power Apps, a yet-to-be-selected Project Management software for managing project tasks, requirements, and related documentation, and Visio for modeling and diagrams. 

# Method/Approach

This project will follow a mostly-standard development lifecycle with the following phases:
- Planning
- Requirements and Analysis
- Design
- Development
- Testing

It will not likely have a deployment or maintenance phase as it is not intended for an enterprise production environment. 

The project management methodology that will be used for this project is Agile with modifications given that there is only one team member. It will include a feature backlog, time-bound sprints, and success measured on units of "shippable product" or working software. 

# Estimated Timeline

Major milestones for this project include:
- Establish initial requirements and feature backlog ( ~ 2 weeks)
- Completion of initial designs and models ( ~ 2 weeks)
- Creation of the project-build platform (where a PM can create a project, add resources, and build the WBS or task list) (~ 3 weeks)
- Creation of the time-recording platform (where a project resource can view assigned tasks, adjust the status of those tasks, and create time entries corresponding to those tasks) (~ 3 weeks)
- Completion of testing (~ 1 week)
- Release (turn-in) project (early December)


# Anticipated Problems

There are several problems ("opportunities") inherent in this project. The first is that I intend to build it in a platform I've never utilized before. This means that I will need to quickly ramp up my skill set to the level required to build a fairly involved application. I intend to do this by availing myself of Microsoft's documentation, online tutorials, videos, and support sites like Stack Overflow. The second issue is one of availability, given that I currently travel for work and work a significant amount, presenting a risk that the project becomes too large for a single resource with limited time. For this reason, I chose the Agile methodology which relies on continuous development and an ever-evolving backlog of features. As I add new requirements and ideas, I will have to strategically pull from the backlog to implement only the most critical or high-priority features as a way of controlling scope creep. If, however, I end up with additional time, I can add additional features from the backlog.
